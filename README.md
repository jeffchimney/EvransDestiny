projects that need work.
 MAP ingame 01 - needs small click on events that give player a little lore snippet into his past or a show of genral emotion.
Item Creation - basic set of every type of weapon that can be wielded needs to be added.
KAni's note side story - this needs to be fleshed out into its own side sotry tht ties back into the main story
			ultimatly changing the outcome of the stroy depending on the characters chioces.
elf lady(cant rmember name) - can be iether a party member or a died person of which you fight depending on what 
				side you take while you talk to here about the statue in the middle of the room.
