Levi and Jeff working on a game.

projects that need work.
 MAP ingame 01 - needs small click on events that give player a little lore snippet into his past or a show of genral emotion.
Item Creation - basic set of every type of weapon that can be wielded needs to be added.
KAni's note side story - this needs to be fleshed out into its own side story that ties back into the main story
			ultimatly changing the outcome of the stroy depending on the characters chioces.
elf lady(cant rmember name) - can be iether a party member or a died person of which you fight depending on what 
				side you take while you talk to here about the statue in the middle of the room.
				note: also need to flesh out a side story for this as well.
Darker incantations -	upon finding and unlocking a demonic rune written in (_____)<idk name yet> the ground 
shakes as you here a bumbling roar deeper into the complex. what dark divine power is down hereand why? 
the connection between this side story and the main story is the fact that the journalist, <Evran> is seaching 
for a dark unbenounced power that has taken this place long ago and has need to collect and keep anyone from using
its power. <including the player, if they want to choose to be>
