pile of rock upheald by unknown means. the cavonus pits below are seemingly endlessand the only way 
in is a small ricketty bridge. after passing across the player soon finds out that hes not the
only one on the floating island, what seems to be purposely torn pages from a journal or study
of this place makes the player, feel intregged on the intersting finds of achiteture and overall
findings these notes carry. no name to be found on them but a symbol, displaying a rune of some sort 
marked each page at the bottom. 
	as the player explores around he/she begins to find out that this place use to be some sort
of dwarven fortress forgotten in time from the rigeress blood shed they faught in the depths ofthe darkness
however the actual fortess only has one semi usable door to get in, and a few windows that iether been crushed
open or are large enough to get to. upon entering into the the door a large corridor spans the hall with
large stone and moldy canvus banners of the dwarven clan that use to dwell here. at the end of the hall
th player finds another note under a large metal statue omunesly looking forward in a gauding stance. looking out
into the foya. upon reading the note the character finds that the statue isnot just for looks but is a acient 
clock work machince biult by the dwarfs later in there years to fight along side them in battle due to the dwarves
